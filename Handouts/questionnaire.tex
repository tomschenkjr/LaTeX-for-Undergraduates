I hope to ascertain the background of students in Professor Alexander's FYS class. Below are simple questions regarding majors, personal interests, computer ability, and hardware. This will help me determine the analogies I use and examples I'll show.

\begin{enumerate}

\item What is your major(s)? Minor(s)?

	\begin{enumerate}

		\item If multiple majors/minors, what is your primary interest?
\\	
	\end{enumerate}

\item What other subjects do you enjoy reading/studying?
\\
\item What classes are you taking this semester? (Don't need to list them all if you don't want)
\\
\item Have you found anything in this FYS particularly interesting?
\\
\item You've used some \textit{Mathematica} already, have you used any other mathematical/statistical suites in other courses or personal time?
\\
\item What operating systems do you use? (e.g. Windows, MacOS, Linux, Unix, Solaris, etc.)
\\
\item Do you own a laptop?
\\
	\begin{enumerate}

		\item What operating system does it use?
\\		
	\end{enumerate}

\item Have you ever made an HTML document? If yes, do you consider yourself a novice, intermediate, or advanced user?
\\
\item Have you ever used advanced markup languages (e.g. CSS, JavaScript, XHTML, etc.)?
\\
