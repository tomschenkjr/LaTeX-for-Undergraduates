Introduction
============
This project contains the source files for the [LaTeX for Undergraduates] tutorial. The tutorial is designed for teaching undergraduate students how to use the LaTeX typesetting program.  The emphasis of this tutorial is to (1) teach the basic of LaTeX; (2) introduce advanced concepts that students may need to use; (3) show how laTeX works with third-party programs (such as Mathematica); (4) provide several references to other literature to entice students to continue learning LaTeX. This repository contains all of the source material used to create the tutorial, permitting the tutorial to be used and adapted.

Organization of Tutorial
------------------------
This tutorial mainly uses slides designed for classroom lectures, however, they are detailed enough so they can be understood outside the classroom. The tutorial is broken down into section and subsections. Each slide show is about 5 to 20 minutes long, so two or three can be presented in a typical class.

File Structure
==============
There are several folders with files, though, some are incomplete. Below is a brief description of the contents of each.

Handouts (Incomplete)
---------------------
Contains a single handout given to participants in the the LaTeX for Undergraduates tutorial at Drake University in 2005. Contains LaTeX and PDF files.

Lecture Notes (Incomplete)
--------------------------
Written documentation intended to accompany the tutorial slides. 

Lecture Recordings (Incomplete)
-------------------------------
Recordings of the first lecture given to the LaTeX for Undergraduates tutorial at Drake University during the fall 2005. Contains AUP files that can be opened with [Audacity].

Slides (Complete)
-----------------
Contains several sub-folders with slides used in the tutorial. Files include LaTeX files, postscript, PDFs, and, when applicable, encapsulated postscript files for images. Each folder contains individual folders for each section and subsection.
